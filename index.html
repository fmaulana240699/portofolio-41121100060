            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Fajar Maulana, I am a highly motivated DevOps Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and automation.
                My expertise spans containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible), and system monitoring.
                In addition to my core DevOps skills, I have a deep passion for coding, with experience in Python, Bash, and Go, which allows me to develop custom tools, scripts, and solutions to optimize workflows and improve system efficiency.
                I thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver robust, scalable, and secure solutions.
